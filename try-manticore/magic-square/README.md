Solve magic square puzzle using Manticore.

The solution my run finds is:

```
00202768: 08 01 06 03 05 07 04 09 02 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  ................
```

So (a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i) is 8,1,6,3,5,7,4,9,2 or:

```
8 1 6
3 5 7
4 9 2
```

You might have to adjust addresses depending on where your compiler places functions.
