# Playing With Miasm

Miasm is a reverse engineering framework in Python: https://github.com/cea-sec/miasm

## Setup

My experience using python 3.10.0:

```
pip3 install future
```

Then, in files `miasm/core/utils.py` and `miasm/ir/symbexec.py` change:
```
  from collections import MutableMapping as DictMixin
```
to:
```
  from collections.abc import MutableMapping as DictMixin
```

In file `miasm/core/cpu.py` change:
```
  base_expr = pyparsing.operatorPrecedence(operand,
```
to:
```
  base_expr = pyparsing.infixNotation(operand,
```

## Use

`./disasm_file.py <file> <function>`

Will make a graph of the function's CFG in /tmp/tmp.dot, like:

![](./example.svg)

Adjust to taste.
