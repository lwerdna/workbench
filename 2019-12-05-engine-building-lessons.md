Engine Building Parables

<div style="position:absolute; background:lightgrey; width:100%">Posted 2019-12-05</div>

In boardgames, there's a mechanic called "engine building" where some valuable game item is produced by an "engine" and the player has to make a choice between immediate production or engine improvement, betting the temporary halt in production will be compensated for by accelerated production. Splendor is the purest demonstration of this I'm familiar with.

In videogames, starcraft comes to mind. Do you stay at your current rate of income and produce fighters? Or forego fighters for workers so that your future income rate will produce even more fighters?

It comes up in life advice too. "Sharpen the Saw" or "Sharpen the Axe" parable applies when you're not engine building enough, only producing. It's better to stop cutting, sacrifice the time needed to sharpen your tool (build your engine!), and return to work if you're goal is fell as many trees as possible.

The Fisherman and Businessman parable applies when you're engine building too much and never producing. The businessman's approach improves and maximimizes growth all through life, never benefitting from production.

Like most things, the right answer appears to be a balance. The best starcraft players don't build only workers, and don't build only attackers. In Splendor you're not competitive buying strictly from the top or strictly from the bottom row.
