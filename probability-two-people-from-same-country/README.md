What are the chances two randomly selected people from Earth are from the same country?

I used the Wikipedia page [List of countries and dependencies by population](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population) for data, [Beautiful Soup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) to parse it, and `./calculate.py` and the answer is **0.072829** or 7.2829%.

The top ten countries contributing to this probability are:

```
"China" population=1411750000 chance=3.254424%
"India" population=1375586000 chance=3.089826%
"United States" population=334233854 chance=0.182415%
"Indonesia" population=275773800 chance=0.124184%
"Pakistan" population=235825000 chance=0.090811%
"Nigeria" population=218541000 chance=0.077987%
"Brazil" population=215689286 chance=0.075965%
"Bangladesh" population=165158616 chance=0.044541%
"Russia" population=146980061 chance=0.035276%
"Mexico" population=128665641 chance=0.027032%
```
