Just cartesian -> polar -> cartesian except r is substituted for 1/r.

This is an attempt to reproduce an effect from the demo "Intrinsic Gravity" by Still.
The triangles' positions lead your eye towards certain lines while their rotations lead to others.

- had seen pics like these, thought they were interesting
- guessed that they were magnetic fields or something
- actually is mapping from sphere points to a plane: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereographic_projection
- long and verbose code, to learn, much more compact implementations exist

That counterspiral pattern in the spiral triangles drawing is sometimes called phyllotactic or phyllotaxis spiral https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phyllotaxis or spiral phyllotaxis.
